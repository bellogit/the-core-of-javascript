*JavaScript* is a popular programming language used both in the browser and server. It was initially called **LiveScript** but later changed to JavaScript. 

The programs in the language are called **script**.

> JavaScript is a high-level, dynamic, untyped, and interpreted programming language. 

> It was created in 10 days by Brendan Eich. ðŸ˜®

It is named JavaScript to position it as a younger brother to Java because Java was more popular back then (in 1995). But they are independent of each other.

JavaScript was changed to ECMAScript or ECMA-262 in 1996 but is still called JavaScript.

It is executed on any device that has a special program called JavaScript engine or **ECMAScript engine**. The engine renders web pages to the **DOM** (**Document Object Model**) for easier interaction between the browser and the user.

The engine is also called **JavaScript Virtual Machine** because it executes code in an environment independent of the platform.

> ECMAScript is the standardized [specification of JavaScript](https://www.ecma-international.org/publications/standards/Ecma-262.htm). It contains the most in-depth detailed information about JavaScript.

There are different JavaScript engine codenames based on the browser. For example, in Chrome and Opera, it is V8; in Firefox, it's Spider Monkey; in Internet Explorer, it's Chakra; in Microsoft Edge, it's ChakraCore; in Safari, it's Nitro and SquirrelFish, etc.

The full integration of JavaScript with HTML and CSS makes JavaScript a unique Programming Language. It also supports all major browsers.
